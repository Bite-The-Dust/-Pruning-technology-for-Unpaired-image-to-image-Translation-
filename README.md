# Exploring Negatives in Contrastive Learning for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation
## Getting Started

### Installation

- Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/YupeiLin2388/Exploring-Negatives-in-Contrastive-Learning-for-Unpaired-Image-to-Image-Translation PUT
cd PUT
```

- Install PyTorch and other dependencies (e.g., torchvision, visdom, dominate, gputil).

  For pip users, please type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### [Datasets](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation/blob/master/docs/datasets.md)
